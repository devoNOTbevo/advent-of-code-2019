# advent-of-code-2019
My Advent of Code challenge solutions for 2019 - written in golang.  I didn't finish before Christmas, but will continue to make commits as I finish the challenges in spare time.

## Why Golang?
I try to write new code challenges in the languages I'm most interested in, which at this time are Go and Rust.  I have a heavy interest in services architecture
and it seems many architects and companies with heavily distributed systems like Golang for multiple reasons.  So I want to continue to learn and stay updated with this language.
